    <p> Aaron Lopez is based in Atlanta, Georgia, and works as a Product Specialist
        for a turnkey EV charging startup. He is also an aspiring software developer with ambitions to become a future
        Product Manager.</p>
        <p>Aaron has a lot he hopes to experience and achieve. He dreams of spending time on the road, where he can immerse
            himself in coding while
            traveling.
            Though not a permanent lifestyle, life on the road is a key item on his bucket list.</p>

            <p>      Aaron Enjoys Running. Running is an excellent way to clear your head or catch up on your
                favorite TV shows. Whether on a treadmill with a screen for entertainment
                or outdoors in a park to enjoy nature, running offers a range of
                enjoyment. Each environment has its own appeal, indoor running allows for
                catching up on your favorite shows, while outdoor running lets you immerse
                yourself in nature.

            <p>
                Currently, Aaron devotes most of his time to his career. Outside of
                work and coding studies, he stays active through weightlifting and
                running. Running on the treadmill doubles as a chance to catch up on
                his favorite shows, like The Lincoln Lawyer. Occasionally, Aaron
                spends time with friends, usually nearby, playing card games or
                joining a poker night. He also enjoys early 2000s sitcoms as his go-to
                comfort shows.
